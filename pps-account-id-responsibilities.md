# Responsibilities for managing consumer account IDs
{: #pps-consumer-account-id-responsibilities}

As a service provider, you are responsible for managing your consumer account IDs. Currently, tracking or validating account IDs is not supported. The responsibility of managing, approving, and revoking consumer account IDs lies entirely with you as the service provider.
{: attention}

## Responsibilities
{: #pps-consumer-responsibilities}

The following are your responsibilities as a Private Path service provider when managing consumer account IDs:

Self-managed tracking

:    You are solely responsible for tracking consumer account IDs. This includes maintaining accurate records and ensuring that each ID is associated with the correct consumer.

Independent validation

:    The validity of each account ID is your responsibility to confirm. You must establish your own mechanisms to ensure that each ID corresponds to a legitimate consumer.

Understanding consequences

:    Be fully aware of the implications of permitting, denying an access request, or revoking an account ID. Inaccurate approval or wrongful revocation can lead to service disruptions.
