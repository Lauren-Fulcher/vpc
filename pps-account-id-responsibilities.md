# Responsibilities for managing consumer account IDs
{: #pps-consumer-account-id-responsibilities}

The following are your responsibilities as a Private Path service provider when managing consumer account IDs:

Self-managed tracking

:    You are solely responsible for tracking consumer account IDs. This includes maintaining accurate records and ensuring that each ID is associated with the correct consumer.

Independent validation

:    The validity of each account ID is your responsibility to confirm. You must establish your own mechanisms to ensure that each ID corresponds to a legitimate consumer.

Understanding consequences

:    Be fully aware of the implications of permitting, denying an access request, or revoking an account ID. Inaccurate approval or wrongful revocation can lead to service disruptions.

Pay attention to these responsibilities when performing these tasks:
