## Where do I find cost estimates for a Private Path service?
{: #pricing-private-path}
{: faq}
{: support}

Private Path services and Virtual Private Endpoint (VPE) gateways are free services. A Private Path network load balancer is charged per hour and per gigabyte of traffic. To estimate the cost of a load balancer, use the cost estimator on the provisioning page (either when you create a Private Path network load balancer during [Private Path service creation](/infrastructure/provision/privatePathService), or from the [Load balancers page](/infrastructure/network/loadBalancers)).

For example, from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **Infrastructure > Network > Private Path services**. Then, click **Create** to open the provisioning page.
