# Attestation with Intel SGX and Data Center Attestation Primitives (DCAP) for Virtual Servers for VPC
{: #about-attestation-sgx-dcap-vpc}

[Select availability]{: tag-green}

Attestation is a process that validates that a runtime environment is instantiated in an encrypted SGX enclave on a system with a known security configuration. Intel SGX DCAP facilitates Attestation.
{: shortdesc}

Confidential computing is only available with select profiles. For more information, see [SGX-compatible profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-sgx-vpc&interface=ui#compatible-profiles-confidential-computing-vpc-sgx).
{: note}

Intel SGX helps protect data in use through application isolation technology. By protecting the integrity and confidentiality of selected code and data, developers can partition their application into hardened enclaves or trusted execution modules to help increase application security.

## Installing attestation with SGX DCAP
{: #configuring-dcap-for-attestation}

The PCK certificate is readily made available in the SGX VSI, thus
eliminating the need to procure from a PCCS service. This certificate is at `/root/.dcap-qcnl/*`.

Install all the required SGX DCAP and QCNL packages; as specified by Intel.

Install DCAP version 1.19 or greater since previous versions do not support locally cached certificates.
{: note}

Reconfigure AESM to use the locally cached PCK certificate and restart the
service as shown in the following example.

```sh
 Configure  /etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf
 "use_secure_cert": false
 "local_cache_only": true

 and restart aesmd

 systemctl restart aesmd
```
{: codeblock}

Non-root user must copy the `/root/.dcap-qcnl/*` directory to their `$HOME` directory to use DCAP.
