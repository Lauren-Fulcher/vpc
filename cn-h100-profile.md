# NVIDIA H100 cluster network profile
{: #cluster-network-h100-profile}

The H100 cluster network profile provides isolated networks for [Hopper HGX H100 instances](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-accelerated-profile-family#hopper-hgx-profiles) running workloads that require high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnectivity, such as AI training and large-scale simulations.
{: shortdesc}

## Overview
{: #cluster-network-h100-profile-overview}

The H100 cluster network profile supports Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over the Convergent Ethernet v2 (RoCEv2) network protocol for increased throughput, reduced latency, and improved system performance.

The supported instance profile is the [Hopper HGX H100 instance profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-accelerated-profile-family#hopper-hgx-profiles).
