# Connecting to the serial console with Windows
{: #connect-to-serial-console-with-windows}


Serial console isn't enabled by default on Windows&reg;. You need to enable it by using the following script.

```sh
#ps1_sysnative
bcdedit /ems on
bcdedit /emssettings EMSPORT:2 EMSBAUDRATE:115200
Restart-Computer
```
{: codeblock}

The restart command works only if the windows `cloudbase-init` service allows for restarts. If not, then you need to manually restart.
