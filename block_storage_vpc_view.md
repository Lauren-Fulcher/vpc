# Viewing {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes
{: #viewing-block-storage}

View details about a {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume or summary information about all volumes.
{: shortdesc}

## Viewing information about {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes in the console
{: #viewvols}
{: ui}

List all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes and view details for a single volume. View attached {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume details in instance details. View all snapshots that were created from the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume.

### Viewing information about all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes in the console
{: #viewvols-ui}

Go to the list of {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, click the **Navigation menu** icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../icons/vpc.svg) **> Storage > Block Storage volumes**.

By default, {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes display for all resource groups in your region. In the list of all **{{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes**, you see the following information.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Region | The region where these volumes are located, for example, US South. Click the down arrow to see volumes in a different region in which you have an account. |
| Name | Click the name of the volume to see individual volume details. |
| Status | Status of the volume, which functions as the default filter for all rows. |
| Location | Availability zone in your region, inherited from the VPC (for example, US South 1).|
| Size | Size of the volume you specified, in GBs.|
| Attachment type | Data, for a secondary volume attached to an instance, boot when attached as a boot volume, or blank for an unattached volume.|
| Health | Health monitors the overall health of the volume, such as I/O performance and data consistency. Volume health statuses are `OK` or `degraded`. Volumes in a degraded state have degraded performance, capacity, or experience connection problems. Volumes being restored from a snapshot also show a degraded state. The service displays a possible reason for the degraded state so that you can resolve any issues. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume health states](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-monitoring#block-storage-vpc-health-states). |
| Encryption | Encryption with IBM-managed keys is enabled by default on all volumes. You can also use your own root keys in a {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} or {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance to protect your data. For more information, see [Creating {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes with customer-managed encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-encryption). |
| Tags | Number of user tags that are applied to the volume. Click the number in this column to view or edit the tags in the new window. If no tags were applied to the volume, click **Add tags** and add them in the new window. User tags can associate the volume with a [backup policy](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about) for creating backups of the volume. For more information, see [Adding user tags that are associated with a backup policy to a volume in the console](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-block-storage&interface=ui#add-user-tags-volumes-ui).
| Actions | Click the Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") to display a menu of context-specific actions you can take. For example, an available, unattached volume would have menu options for attaching to an instance, renaming, and deleting the volume. An attached volume would allow for unattaching the volume from an instance and creating an [image from the volume](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-image-from-volume-vpc).|
{: caption="Details about all volumes" caption-side="bottom"}

By default, 10 volumes are shown in the list of all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes. Change this default by clicking the Page Control down arrow and increase the list to 20 or 50 volumes. Use the Page Control arrows after the list to go to the following page or return to the current page.

Actions menu selections change, depending on whether the volume is a boot volume, an attached data volume, or an unattached data volume. Table 2 describes these actions.

| Volume type | Action | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **Boot** | Create image. | Create an image from the boot volume. For more information, see [Creating an image from a volume in the console](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-ifv&interface=ui#create-image-from-volume-vpc-ui).
| | Create snapshot. | Create a "bootable" snapshot from the boot volume. A snapshot is a point in time copy of the volume. For more information, see [Creating a snapshot in the console](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-create&interface=ui#snapshots-vpc-create-ui).
| | Detach from instance. | If the boot volume is attached as a secondary volume, you can [detach it](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-block-storage#detach) from the instance. |
| **Data** | Create snapshot. | Create a point in time copy of the data volume. |
| | Detach from instance. | [Detach](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-block-storage#detach) the data volume from the instance. |
| | Delete. | [Delete](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-block-storage#delete) the volume. You must first detach the volume from an instance before you attempt to delete it. |
| Unattached (-) | Attach to an instance. | [Attach](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-attaching-block-storage) the volume to an available virtual server instance. |
| | Delete. | Delete the unattached volume. |

### Viewing details of a {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume
{: #view-vol-details-ui}

To view details about a {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume, go to the list of all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes and select a volume. By default, the Overview tab is selected for volume details. To view a list of snapshots that were created manually or by a backup policy, click the **Snapshots and Backups** tab.

Next to the name of the volume is the [volume status](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-monitoring#block-storage-vpc-status) and tags that are associated with this volume. [User tags](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about&interface=ui#storage-about-user-tags) identify the resource. When user tags are associated with a backup policy, they are used for creating [backup snapshots](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about) of the volume. With [Access management tags](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about&interface=ui#storage-about-mgt-tags), you can create flexible resource groupings for managing access. For more information about these tags, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag).

The Actions menu on the volume details page shows the actions that you can take, depending on whether the volume is a boot or data volume, and attached or unattached. For more information, see Table 4.

The {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes details page shows volume details, attached virtual server instances, and backup policies. Table 3 describes this information.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|

Volume names must be unique for the account and for the region. |
| Volume ID | System-generated volume ID. |
| Health |  Health monitors the overall health of the volume, such as I/O performance and data consistency. Volume health statuses are `OK` or `degraded`. Volumes in a degraded state have less than OK performance, capacity, or experience connection problems. Volumes that are being restored from a snapshot also show a degraded state. The service displays a possible reason for the degraded state so you can resolve it. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume health states](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-monitoring#block-storage-vpc-health-states). |
| Resource group | Resource group defined when you set up your VPC. Resource groups manage access to resources but do not affect billing or monitoring.|
| Attachment type | Data, for a secondary volume attached to an instance, boot when attached as a boot volume, or blank for an unattached volume.|
| Created date | System-generated date when the volume was created.|
| Location | Availability zone in your region.|
| Size | Size of the volume you specified. When the volume is attached to a virtual server instance and the volume is not at maximum capacity for its range, you can click the icon to expand the volume. For more information, see [expanding {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume capacity (Beta)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-expanding-block-storage-volumes). |

| Max IOPS | Maximum IOPS value for a predefined IOPS tier or the value you specified for custom IOPS. |
| Throughput | The field shows the allocated bandwidth of the storage volume, measured in Gigabits per second (Gbps). Throughput is calculated as the result of the number IOPS the volume is provisioned for times the throughput multiplier. Depending on the [volume profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles), the throughput multiplier can be 16 KB or 256 KB. |
| Encryption | Encryption with IBM-managed keys is enabled by default on all volumes. You can also use your own root keys to protect your data. The Encryption field shows the name of the key management service (KMS) you provisioned (for example, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}) and **customer-managed**. For more information, see [Creating {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes with customer-managed encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-encryption).|
| Encryption Instance | _Optional._ A link to the provisioned KMS instance for a customer-managed encryption volume. |
| Key | _Optional._ The name and copiable ID of the root key that is used to encrypt the passphrase, which secures a customer-managed encryption volume. |

{: screen}

In the example, the volume is attached to a virtual server instance, so the named and IDd of the volume attachment and instance are also displayed in the command output. The Active property is `true` because the virtual server instance to which the volume is attached is running. The `busy` property with the value `false` indicates that this volume is not performing an operation that must be serialized.

For more information about available command options, see [`ibmcloud is volume`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-vpc-reference#volume-view).

### Viewing all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes from the CLI
{: #viewall-vol-cli}

Run this command to list summary information about all volumes:

```sh
ibmcloud is volumes [--json]
```
{: pre}

Specifying the resource group ID or name filters the list to volumes that belong to a resource group. When you omit this argument, it defaults to all resource groups. You can also view all volumes in a particular availability zone.

By default, the first 25 volumes are displayed per page.

The following example shows all volumes for all resource groups in your availability zone.

```sh
$ ibmcloud is volumes

## Viewing {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes with the API
{: #viewing-block-storage-api}
{: api}

View {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes programmatically by making calls to the [VPC REST APIs](/apidocs/vpc). You can list all volumes and view details for a specific volume.

Before you begin, make sure that you [set up your API environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-block-storage#block-storage-api-prereqs).

### Viewing all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes with the API
{: #viewall-vol-api}

Make a `GET /volumes` call to list summary information about all volumes. See the following example.

```sh
curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/volumes?version=2022-12-09&generation=2" \
-H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: pre}

A successful response looks like the following example. This example shows three data volumes. The first in the list is attached to an instance.

### Viewing volume details with the API
{: #viewvol-details-api}

Make a `GET /volumes/{id}` call to see details of a volume. See the following example.

```sh
curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/volumes/$volume_id?version=2022-12-09&generation=2" \
-H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: pre}

A successful response provides details of the volume, including capacity and IOPS, the volume status, and whether the volume is attached to an instance.

### Extra properties for boot volumes
{: #viewvol-boot}

When you request to view details of boot volumes, a couple of extra properties are returned in a `GET /volumes` and `GET /volumes/{id}` response.

* The `active` property indicates whether the virtual server instance to which a volume is attached is running or stopped. When `active = true`, the instance is running and operations that require a running instance such as creating an [image from that boot volume](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-ifv#image-from-volume-vpc-api) also work.

* The `busy` property indicates whether this volume is performing an operation that must be serialized. If an operation requires serialization, the operation fails unless this property is `false`.

See the following example.

```json
  "active": "true",
  "busy": "false",
  "capacity": 100,
  "created_at": "2022-12-08T06:26:17Z",
  "crn": "crn:[...]",
  "encryption": "provider_managed",
  "href": "https://us-south.iaas.cloud.ibm.com/v1/volumes/ccbe6fe1-5680-4865-94d3-687076a38293",
